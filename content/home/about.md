# Biography

I am a Second Year Graduate Student pursuing Masters in Robotics Engineering at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/study/robotics-engineering-ms). I completed my B.Tech from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/) with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie broadly in the fields of Robotics and Computer Vision for solving real world problems.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Emmanuel Agu](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~emmanuel/) and in collaboration with UMass Memorial Medical Centre, Worcester for developing a lower extremity wound diagnostics app ([Smartwands](http://smartwands.wpi.edu/)) that can provide an automatic decision support system for patients. This project involves all-round work ranging from wound segmentation, healing score calculation, data collection and filtering, collaboration with doctors and providing a final decision to patients. 

During the summer of 2018, I interned at [Amazon Robotics](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/) in the perception division of the Advanced Robotics group where I built a working demonstration of detection and filling of missing data points in 3D point clouds using movable sensors. This project included working with OpenCV, ROS, 3D sensors, cameras, Point Cloud Library and motion planning of robotic arms. I am also working currently under [Dr. Carlo Pinciroli](https://carlo.pinciroli.net/) on simulating pattern detection using robot swarms in the presence of lying agents.

During my underegrad, I worked on lane detection and localisation for self-driving cars for the [Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition](http://www.igvc.org/) under the guidance of [Dr. Gaurav Pandey](http://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/gaurav-pandey). I was also an active member of [Team Robocon IIT Kanpur](http://students.iitk.ac.in/robocon/) taking part in [ABU Robocon](http://aburobocon.net/) in 2014, 2015 and 2016. As part of the team, I have worked on the programming, design and fabrication of [Line Following and Pole Climbing Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAes6m6usg),  [Badminton Playing bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LFS0ITb_V4) and [Autonomous Pole Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoDn82fd3Tk&t=21s) under the guidance of [Dr. Bhaskar Dasgupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~dasgupta/) and [Dr. Anjali Kulkarni](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~anjalik/).
