# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Created a simulation engine for pedestrians which takes obstacles, initial and goal positions of pedestrians as input and generates paths calculated using force models like Helbing and Power Law. Parameters for these models were obtained by real world experiments where SIFT features of pedestrians were tracked from videos using CamShift algorithm [[Slides](http://spjain.github.io/resources/pedestrian-simulation.pdf)]"
